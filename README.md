This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, to run this app locally, create a Pexels API Key by the following instructions:

1. Create a free account https://www.pexels.com/onboarding
2. Navigate to Image & Video API and fill the form to create a key

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your directory and add the following:
` NEXT_PEXELS_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel
